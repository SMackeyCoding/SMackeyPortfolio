        <div id="aboutMe">
            <p>Before entering the world of coding, I attended Indiana University - Bloomington studying how to speak Mandarin. Once I graduated, I still wanted to learn more and figured the best way to learn is to immerse myself, so I found a job teaching English in China, figuring that with my knowledge of both English and Chinese, I could better help those wanted to learn English.</p>
            <p>After spending just over a year teaching overseas, I decided it was time to come home to Indiana and search for a job. While I did find a job, it wasn't one that utilized my language abilities, and there weren't really any other options available, so instead of doing something I wasn't passionate about, I decided to learn a new skill, coding.</p>
            <p>I was toying around with the idea of coding, and one day an ad popped up about Eleven Fifty Academy. I was hesitant, but the moment I saw that they had free intro courses, I figured I had nothing to lose by attending one session. If I didn't like it, I'd consider a different study, if I did like it, I'd research a bit more and sign up. Thankfully, it was something I enjoyed and decided to pursue.</p>
            <p>So now, I am still currently employed as a Customer Service Rep at a timeshare exchange company, but I am also taking part-time classes at Eleven Fifty Academy</p>

                    <h4>CSS Creature</h4>
                    <p>We were to make something only using CSS. After brainstorming what to do, I figured Morty from the TV Show Rick and Morty would be a good idea. I also implemented and modified an earlier assignment of creating a smiley face, and molded it after Morty's face, and figured it'd make sense in that universe to have it floating underneath a saucer.</p>
